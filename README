This program is written in Java, IDE : NetBean
We support two types of chat:
	Without server:
		Clients can chat together if they know the ip and port of each other.
	With server:
		Clients want to chat must register to the chat server and receive the list of users online from that server.
		Double click to users online from the list, you can chat with them now.

The chat client also have some bonus features such as:
	Choose font for text 
	Send file
	Emoticons

To use it over internet, you must configure your router to open the dedicated port for clients.

Be care of using the same port at the same IP when open both server and clients in the same computer for testing purpose.
